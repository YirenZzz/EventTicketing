# Event Ticketing and QR Code Check-in System

## 1. Motivation

### Problem Statement

Event management continues to be a challenging process, particularly for small to medium-sized organizations, educational institutions, and community groups.

Current challenges include inefficient registration processes where many organizations still rely on manual registration methods such as paper forms, spreadsheets, and email that are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

Attendance tracking difficulties arise from traditional check-in methods using printed lists or manual verification, leading to long queues, errors in recording attendance, and lack of real-time visibility.

Event organizers often lack tools to efficiently analyze attendance patterns, which prevents data-driven decision-making for future events. Without accurate predictions of attendance, organizers struggle to appropriately allocate resources such as space, staff, and refreshments.

Additionally, maintaining timely communication with registrants about event updates, reminders, and changes is difficult without a centralized system.

### Why This Project is Worth Pursuing

This project addresses these challenges by creating a comprehensive, yet accessible web-based platform that streamlines the entire event management lifecycle.

The system will increase operational efficiency by automating registration, ticket generation, and check-in processes, allowing organizations to reduce administrative overhead and focus on event content and experience.

It will improve attendee experience through streamlined registration and contactless check-in, creating a more professional and frictionless experience for participants.

The platform enables data-driven decision making with real-time analytics that provide organizers with valuable insights about attendance patterns, helping them optimize future events.

Communication is enhanced through automated confirmations, reminders, and updates to ensure attendees receive timely information about events. Additionally, by eliminating paper-based processes, the platform contributes to environmental sustainability goals.

### Target Users

Our platform targets several distinct user groups.

Event organizers include staff from universities, clubs, non-profits, small businesses, and community organizations who need to efficiently create and manage events. They typically have limited technical resources but require professional event management capabilities.

Event staff are individuals responsible for on-site operations including attendee check-in, who need intuitive, reliable tools that work efficiently even in challenging environments such as poor internet connectivity or time pressure.

Attendees are participants who register for and attend events, ranging from students and community members to professionals. They expect straightforward registration processes and seamless check-in experiences.

Administrators are technical personnel responsible for overseeing the platform, managing user permissions, and ensuring data integrity across multiple events and organizers.

### Existing Solutions and Limitations

While several commercial platforms exist such as Eventbrite, Ticket Tailor, and Eventzilla, they present limitations that our solution aims to address.

Many existing platforms charge significant per-ticket fees or require expensive subscriptions, making them inaccessible for smaller organizations or free events.

Commercial solutions often restrict branding and registration form customization without premium subscriptions. Many platforms have limited ability to integrate with existing organizational systems or export data in useful formats.

Enterprise-level solutions often include excessive features that create unnecessary complexity for smaller events.

Some commercial platforms impose restrictive terms on data collected through their systems, limiting organizers' ability to maintain relationships with their attendees.

Our platform will focus on core functionality that addresses these pain points while remaining accessible and intuitive for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
